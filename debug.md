 Scene 1: Impact Open (0-2 seconds)
Duration: 2 seconds
Prompt:
Black screen SLAMS to copper hexagon shape flying toward camera at high speed. Shape shatters on impact into hundreds of fragments. Fragments freeze mid-air for a split second. Bold text "CPU" punches in with heavy motion blur. Hard cut to black. Fast, aggressive, high contrast. Flat 2D motion graphics style, no 3D.

Scene 2: The Split (2-5 seconds)
Duration: 3 seconds
Prompt:
Screen splits vertically with sharp wipe transition. Left panel: Copper token icon bounces in with overshoot animation, text "HOLD" types rapidly below. Right panel: Gold coins cascade down like slot machine, text "EARN" types rapidly. Panels slam together, merge into equals sign. Fast scaling, rotation, position keyframes. Punchy easing. Bold sans-serif typography. Copper and gold on black.

Scene 3: The System (5-9 seconds)
Duration: 4 seconds
Prompt:
Rapid-fire icon sequence flying across screen left to right with motion trails: SOL icon → arrow → swap symbol spinning → arrow → GOLD icon → arrow → wallet icon filling up. Each icon SNAPS into position with bounce. Numbers rapidly count up (0→1000→5000→25000). Progress bar races across bottom of screen. Percentage multipliers (1.5x, 2x, 3x) pop and scale aggressively. Solana purple accents. Kinetic typography: "SWAP" "STACK" "EARN" words zoom past camera.

Scene 4: Tier Flash (9-12 seconds)
Duration: 3 seconds
Prompt:
Four tier badges SLAM in rapid succession - Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond - each with screen shake and flash frame. Camera zooms through each badge like flying through portals. Multiplier numbers grow bigger with each tier (1x → 1.5x → 2x → 3x). Speed lines and particle trails. Final diamond tier EXPLODES into golden particles that swirl into vortex. High velocity, constant motion, no static frames.

Scene 5: Logo Slam (12-15 seconds)
Duration: 3 seconds
Prompt:
All particles converge rapidly to center. Screen flashes white. CPU logo SLAMS down with massive impact ring expanding outward. Logo has subtle copper-to-gold gradient animation. Tagline "HOLD COPPER. MINE GOLD." snaps in below with stagger animation on each word. Solana badge slides in from bottom. Screen pulses once. Hard cut to black with URL lingering for half second. Maximum impact energy.
